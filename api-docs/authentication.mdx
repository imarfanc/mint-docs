# Authentication

The Summer Notes API currently operates as a public API without authentication requirements. This makes it easy to test and integrate during development.

## Current Setup

- **No API Keys Required**: All endpoints are publicly accessible
- **No Rate Limiting**: Currently no rate limits are enforced
- **CORS Enabled**: Cross-origin requests are supported

## Headers

While authentication is not required, it's recommended to include standard headers in your requests:

```http
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
```

## Future Considerations

In future versions, the API may implement:

- API key authentication
- Rate limiting
- User-specific note access
- Permission-based operations

## Example Request

```javascript
fetch('https://arfan-notes.val.run/api/notes', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Accept': 'application/json'
  }
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data));
```
