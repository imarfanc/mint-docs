# Archive Note

Archive a note by setting its `archived` status to `true`. Archived notes are hidden from regular views but can still be retrieved with filters.

## Path Parameters

<ParamField path="id" type="integer" required>
  The unique identifier of the note to archive
</ParamField>

## Examples

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X PATCH "https://arfan-notes.val.run/api/notes/23/archive" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

```javascript JavaScript
const noteId = 23;

const response = await fetch(`https://arfan-notes.val.run/api/notes/${noteId}/archive`, {
  method: 'PATCH',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});

const archivedNote = await response.json();
console.log(archivedNote);
```

```python Python
import requests

note_id = 23

response = requests.patch(
    f'https://arfan-notes.val.run/api/notes/{note_id}/archive',
    headers={'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
)

archived_note = response.json()
print(archived_note)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Response

<ResponseExample>
```json Success Response
{
  "id": 23,
  "title": "Advanced CSS Techniques",
  "content": "Modern CSS techniques including Grid, Flexbox, and custom properties...",
  "category": "css",
  "group": "first",
  "color": "primary",
  "archived": true,
  "createdAt": "2024-01-25T14:30:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2024-01-25T17:20:00Z"
}
```

```json Error Response (Note Not Found)
{
  "error": "Note with ID 23 not found"
}
```

```json Error Response (Already Archived)
{
  "error": "Note is already archived"
}
```
</ResponseExample>

## Behavior

- Sets the `archived` field to `true`
- Updates the `updatedAt` timestamp
- Returns the complete updated note object
- Archived notes can still be retrieved using the filtered endpoint with `archived=true`

## Use Cases

- **Content Management**: Remove outdated notes from active views
- **Organization**: Keep historical notes without cluttering the main interface
- **Soft Delete**: Archive instead of permanently deleting notes
- **Workflow Management**: Mark completed or obsolete notes as archived

## Related Endpoints

- Use [Unarchive Note](/api/notes/unarchive-note) to restore an archived note
- Use [Get Filtered Notes](/api/notes/get-filtered-notes) with `archived=true` to retrieve archived notes
- Use [Get Filtered Notes](/api/notes/get-filtered-notes) with `archived=false` to exclude archived notes
