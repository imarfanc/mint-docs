after user clicks run button make the card grayscale to visually show that the code has been executed

I'll help you add a grayscale effect to the code card after the run button is clicked. This will require adding state to track whether the code has been executed and applying conditional styling.

```plaintext
export const CodeRunner = (props) => {
  const code = props.code;
  const language = props.language || "bash";
  const filename = props.filename;

  // Add state to track if code has been executed
  const [isExecuted, setIsExecuted] = React.useState(false);

// ... existing code ...

  const handleRun = async () => {
    await copyToClipboard(code);
    try {
      window.location.href = 'kmtrigger://macro=web_2_terminal';
      // Mark as executed after successful trigger
      setIsExecuted(true);
    } catch (err) {
      console.error('Could not trigger URL scheme:', err);
      // Still mark as executed even if URL scheme fails
      setIsExecuted(true);
    }
  };

// ... existing code ...

  return (
    <div 
      className="hover:!border-primary dark:hover:!border-primary-light"
      style={{
        margin: "20px 0",
        borderRadius: "12px",
        overflow: "hidden",
        border: "1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)",
        backgroundColor: "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)",
        backdropFilter: "blur(10px)",
        WebkitBackdropFilter: "blur(10px)",
        boxShadow: "0 8px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)",
        // Add grayscale filter when executed
        filter: isExecuted ? "grayscale(100%)" : "none",
        opacity: isExecuted ? 0.7 : 1,
        transition: "filter 0.3s ease, opacity 0.3s ease"
      }}
    >
```

Perfect! I've successfully modified the CodeRunner component to add a grayscale effect after the run button is clicked. Here's what I changed:

1. **Added React import**: Added the necessary React import at the top of the file
2. **Added state tracking**: Added `isExecuted` state using `React.useState(false)` to track whether the code has been executed
3. **Updated handleRun function**: Modified the function to set `isExecuted` to `true` after the code execution attempt (whether successful or not)
4. **Applied visual effects**: Added conditional styling to the main container:
   - `filter: "grayscale(100%)"` when executed to make it grayscale
   - `opacity: 0.7` when executed to slightly fade it
   - `transition` for smooth animation effects

Now when a user clicks the "Run" button:
1. The code gets copied to clipboard
2. The URL scheme gets triggered (for terminal integration)
3. The card immediately transitions to a grayscale appearance with reduced opacity
4. The transition is smooth (0.3s) for a polished user experience

The visual feedback clearly indicates that the code has been executed, providing users with immediate confirmation of their action.

nice, please add blur as well to make it more visually obvious

```plaintext
        boxShadow: "0 8px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)",
        filter: isExecuted ? "grayscale(100%)" : "none",
        opacity: isExecuted ? 0.7 : 1,
        transition: "filter 0.3s ease, opacity 0.3s ease"

->

        boxShadow: "0 8px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)",
        filter: isExecuted ? "grayscale(100%) blur(2px)" : "none",
        opacity: isExecuted ? 0.7 : 1,
        transition: "filter 0.3s ease, opacity 0.3s ease"
```

Perfect! I've added a blur effect to make the executed state even more visually obvious. Now when the run button is clicked, the code card will have:

1. **Grayscale effect** - removes all color
2. **Blur effect** - adds a 2px blur to make the content appear "disabled"
3. **Reduced opacity** - makes it slightly transparent
4. **Smooth transition** - all effects animate in smoothly over 0.3 seconds

The combination of grayscale, blur, and reduced opacity will make it very clear that the code has been executed and the card is in a "used" state. The blur effect particularly helps convey that the code block is no longer the active focus.
