## 4. Open Apps via Terminal (Developer Quickstart)
1. Press **⌘ Command + Space**  
2. Type `Terminal` → Press Enter  
3. Copy/paste this command (it opens 4 apps at once):

```bash
open -a Safari
open -a Clock
open -a Notes
open -a "Activity Monitor"
```

<CodeRunner 
  code={`open -a Safari
open -a Clock
open -a Notes
open -a "Activity Monitor"`}
  language="bash"
/>

**Press Enter** - all apps will launch simultaneously!

### Next Steps for Developers
1. Install Xcode from App Store (essential for macOS dev)
2. Install Homebrew (package manager):
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
3. Configure Git:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
```

### Pro Tips
- Use `⌘ Command + Tab` to switch between open apps  
- Safari is pre-logged into Apple services (App Store, iCloud)  
- Activity Monitor shows running processes (like Task Manager on Windows)  
- You can sign into Apple ID later in > System Settings > Apple ID

This process takes 60-90 minutes total. You'll have a clean, bloatware-free macOS installation ready for development tools!
